# chameleonTalk

Group number: 10

Project title: Chameleon Talk System (CTS)

Project description:
Our project is a web application that includes an auto-translation feature which allows two random users to text or voice chat (with subtitles/captions)  anonymously without having to worry about language preference. The objective of this project is to break the language barrier globally and bring cross-cultural/multilingual communications to a whole new level.
